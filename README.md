# Text Summarization
A project using NLTK to analyze and summarize text by tokenizing, filtering stop words, and selecting the most relevant sentences based on word frequencies.

## Description
This project leverages the Natural Language Processing (NLP) library NLTK to perform text summarization. The process begins by loading the text, followed by tokenization of the text into words and sentences. Stop words (common but unimportant words) and punctuation are filtered out, ensuring that only significant words are considered for further analysis. By calculating the frequency of each wordâ€™s occurrence, the most relevant words are identified. Each sentence is scored based on how many important words it contains, with the highest-scoring sentences selected to form a concise summary of the text. This approach ensures that the summary retains the core meaning and key points of the original text.
